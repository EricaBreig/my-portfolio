### Description

This was my second homework assignment at coding bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate my understanding of how to develope a webpage using CSS and HTML, and to have a portfolio webpage developed for when I'm ready to present my work to potential employers.

In this assignment, I learned the following:

- How to build a web page from scratch using HTMl and CSS
- How to properly utilize flexbox to create layouts
- How to use a "hero image"
- How to use images as links, and how to add buzz text over a link
- utilizing bootstrap stylesheet for styling and responsiveness
